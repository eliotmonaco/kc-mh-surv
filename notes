Validity checks
- Subscales: check for responses that are all the same number
- Sample: check that demographics and geography match known/estimated pop.


PSQI measure
- check scoring methodology
- reject scores with percent > 100


Scatter plot to check correlation between
- sleep quality & anxiety


Age groups
- generally use ACS groups
- age groups okay, add 65+ and 85+
  - raw data contains age group only, not year of age, so it's possible to lump existing groups (e.g., lump the 75+ into the 65+ group) but we can't split any groups
